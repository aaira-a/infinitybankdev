00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
What is Bitregion...

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,600
and how can you get a donation up to 30,000 BTC...

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,720
by just contributing only 0.15 BTC to the community?

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:18,360
before that, how about we see how donation can help to collect hugh amount of money within a short period of time.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:26,400
Lets say if you urgently need financial help and there are 30,000 over the internet that feel sympathy with your emergency situation...

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,319
If everyone contribute 1 BTC each, the donation fund collected is about 30,000 BTC.

7
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:35,920
Actually, it is really simple.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,239
It's just that, you are not in the position that this 30,000 people feels sympathy with your situation...

9
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,159
And not to mention how to collect 1 BTC from each of them without any valid reason.

10
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,800
Another way that sounds interesting is playing 'Mutual Fund'.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:06:01,079
Have you heard about 'Mutual Fund' scheme before this?
