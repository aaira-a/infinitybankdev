00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.140
What is Bitregion...

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.585
and how can you get a donation up to 30,000 BTC...

3
00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:10.710
by just contributing only 0.15 BTC to the community?

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.350
before that. how about we see how donation can help to collect hugh amount of money within a short period of time.

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.403
Lets say if you urgently need financial help and there are 30,000 over the internet that feel sympathy with your emergency situation...

6
00:00:26.403 --> 00:00:33.303
If everyone contribute 1 BTC each. the donation fund collected is about 30,000 BTC.

7
00:00:33.303 --> 00:00:35.913
Actually. it is really simple.

8
00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:42.230
It's just that. you are not in the position that this 30,000 people feels sympathy with your situation...

9
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.143
And not to mention how to collect 1 BTC from each of them without any valid reason.

10
00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:51.813
Another way that sounds interesting is playing 'Mutual Fund'.

11
00:00:51.813 --> 00:00:54.500
Have you heard about 'Mutual Fund' scheme before this?

12
00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.993
It is actually a turn-based contribution that requires a group of donors to contribute to a spesific person...

13
00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:04.008
within an agreed time. As example...

14
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:09.758
there are 10 people and each one of them donates 3000 BTC to this person

15
00:01:09.758 --> 00:01:15.183
so. 30,000 BTC can be collected within a spesific time. But...

16
00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:20.890
it is only a turn-based scheme and if the frequency of the payment set is for 1 month...

17
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.332
you'll have to wait until 10 month to get your money back.

18
00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:27.098
Only if everyone pays on time.

19
00:01:27.098 --> 00:01:33.322
and if we have to contribute every month. isn't it better if we save it in the bank?

20
00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:43.003
so... is there a better way to collect donations or get help from the crowd without troubling and even giving benefits to the donator?

21
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.310
defenitly there is... introducing to you...

22
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.178
Bitregion

23
00:01:48.178 --> 00:01:52.020
Bitregion is a donation community that is systematically built...

24
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.442
specifically to every member to get donation from other members in a fair. organized and automatically structured. 

25
00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:01.035
How does it work?

26
00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:08.003
To first join Bitregion community. you need to contribute 0.15 BTC to a qualified receiver in your network.

27
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:15.503
Every member has the rights to get donation or more specifically known as LEVEL.which is from LEVEL1 to LEVEL8.

28
00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:24.948
By just donating that 0.15bitcoin. you are now an IMMIGRANT and qualified to receive contribution from Generation LEVEL1 donators.

29
00:02:24.948 --> 00:02:34.525
This means. Bitregion system will automatically assign 3 other IMMIGRANT donators that will directly contribute 0.15 BTC each...

30
00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:41.497
directly to your bitcoin wallet. So. you’ll get 0.45 BTC in LEVEL1.

31
00:02:41.497 --> 00:02:48.385
Let say you have collected donation 0.15 BTC from 3 donators for 0.45 BTC...

32
00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:55.460
then. you should now upgrade to LEVEL 2 VISAHOLDER for 0.45 BTC

33
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.940
It seems you don’t get profit in LEVEL 1 yet. but you are now a full member and...

34
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.582
entitled to Provide Help in our Region Bank to get 1% daily profit. We’ll explain this later.

35
00:03:08.582 --> 00:03:14.210
In the donation hybrid system. you’ll actually earn profit when you are in LEVEL 2! 

36
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:23.215
You’ll get 0.45bitcoin from 9 other donators. This means that you’ll get total donation collection of 4.05 BTC.

37
00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:27.828
You can get these donations from Generation LEVEL 2 in your network. 

38
00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:36.112
And. even if you can’t finish these 9 slots. you can still upgrade to LEVEL 3 PERMANENT-RESIDENT for only 0.9 BTC. 

39
00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:46.082
So. here you already have profit of 3.15 BTC. plus. you can get extra 12.15 BTC from generation LEVEL 3 of your network

40
00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:50.320
This will continue up to LEVEL 8. and as a PRESIDENT in Bitregion...

41
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.310
you can get donations from 8 GENERATION LEVELS in your network worth up to 30,000 BTC.

42
00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.632
Amazing right?

43
00:03:59.632 --> 00:04:06.082
It’s really amazing and legal because it is a sincere donation contribution from member to member.

44
00:04:06.082 --> 00:04:14.245
Donation is made directly from member’s bitcoin wallet to another member’s bitcoin wallet. and it’s totally transparent.

45
00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:19.755
Bitregion is really a simple profitable community program that everyone should join.

46
00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:26.015
Not only you can turn your 0.15 BTC to get donation up to 30,000 BTC...

47
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:35.007
but also you can simply earn 1% daily profit. or 30% monthly if you help other members in our Region Bank!

48
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:39.178
The Region Bank facilitates members who find it hard to find new donators...

49
00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:43.287
but they still can earn more by Providing Help to the community members. 

50
00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:49.782
This is also known as PH. Then. your right to GET HELP will increase 1% per day...

51
00:04:49.782 --> 00:04:55.727
or 30% monthly when you are helping other members in Bitregion.

52
00:04:55.727 --> 00:05:00.147
So after you have helped others. at anytime you need help in the future...

53
00:05:00.147 --> 00:05:05.192
you can then rely on Region Bank millions of community members to help you back.

54
00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:11.035
